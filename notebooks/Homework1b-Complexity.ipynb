    "One theme of the first lecture was the idea that even simple (cognitive) models can sometimes give rise to complex, non-intutive behaviors.  As a result, we often need computer simulations to help understand how even simple theories will play out.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine a simple experiment where you roll two die and keep going until a particular pair comes up (say 7,11).  What is the distribution of the number of rolls needed to reach this outcome?  While we can certainly figure this out analytically, we might also make a simple program that simulates the process of rolling two die, and observe the results by having the computer run the game hundreds of thousands of times  (i.e., monte carlo method).  In this case, a *simulation* of the physical process of rolling dice can help us understand the behavior of the real system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we start trying to understand human cognitive processes or the structure of social behavior, we basically have to use simulations as there are unlikely to be simple, closed-form mathematical expressions that capture the phenomena.  \n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "For simple systems the simulation approach is not particularly more interesting than doing the math.  However, in the examples we will consider in this part of the homework, sometimes what you get out of the simulation is more than you expect.  This can highlight the value of a simulation-based approach to modeling but also can raise our intuitions about how even simple models can quickly become hard to analyze.\n",

    "**Emergence** is a concept by which some larger pattern or form comes into being through the interactions for smaller and simpler things.  Conway's Game of Life is a particularly unique case because the patterns the emerge and that you described above are sometimes call \"artificial life\" because the hang to together as patterns we recognize as almost being \"alive\".  Out of the primodial computational soup of the game rules, we find creatures which crawl around, bang into one another, exist as stable pattern for eternity and which maybe even \"birth\" new creatures.  This highlight just another way in which simple systems can give rise to patterns of complexity which are very hard to predict and hard to describe analytically.\n",
