    "Ok, why are we basing our first lab around the concept of linear regression?  Well it turns out regression (and correlation) are two of the workhorses of a cognitive scientist's toolkit.  Linear regression models are highly interpretable, are used in many places in cognitive science, are fast and simply to perform, and expose some of the basic issues in modeling data.  If there is one tool I use over and over in my work it is linear regression of some type!\n",
    "\n",
    "Some example uses:\n",
    "- Often linear regression is used to \"control\" for nusiance variables in the study that might be confounded.   For example by fitting a linear multiple regression model you can remove the variance in our data attributable to known sources and then model the **residuals** (more on this later).\n",
    "- The standard analysis techniques for fMRI are based on the General Linear Model which is a kind of generalization of multiple linear regression.  Thus you are getting some of the basics for fMRI analysis.\n",
    "- Regression is often used to measure latent cognitive variables.  For instance one might be interested in how reaction time changes as a function of task difficulty (e.g., number of distractors present in a task).  Here linear regression is nice because the slope of the regression provides an interprable number which explains how reaction time changes as a function of the task.\n",

There is a long running joke/meme about companies that claim to use \"machine learning\" to analyze data to make \"business insights\" actually use linear regression (well a special type called logistic regression).  The issue is that complex linear models, particularly multiple linear regression with many input predictors, can mimic a lot of the power of things like neural networks while being more stable, computationally tractable, etc...  So, even if a machine learning company doesn't use linear regression in their final product, often you have to show that your model does **better** than linear regression to be useful.  Thus, linear regression is like the default modeling approach that is often hard to beat!"

Fitting thus mean adjusting some internal numbers so that the better reflect the underlying data set.  Well when a human (or machine) learns it, it is in some sense of the same thing.  We change the connections of the weights (or parameters) inside our brains to help us better predict our environment.  For instance if your roommate is prone to late night partying and being grumpy the next day you might mentally fit a model to the experiences you have and \"learn\" what features are predictive of them being grumpy.
