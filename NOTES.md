# Notes on LHC Revamp

- possibly a Jupyter book format for a textbook
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis steps for labs
- writing the lab papers using Jupyter notebooks that export to APA format perhaps?
- Is there a good way to do reference managing in Jupyter?
- start up kubernetes cluster for the class
- autopull from the LHC repository
- auto grading for quizes?  how to submit from within the cluster?


./course-materials
 - ./book (a jupyter book rendered guide to the material and readings)
 - ./quizes (a set of jupyter based quizes that are released after before each class)
 - ./homeworks (a set of jupyter based homeworks that teach some more substantic content)
 - ./labs (a set of materials based around a)
 - ./slides (set of slides for the class)

# Content for book and lectures

Each book chapter should be broken into a set of sections which aren't much more than a page.
The idea is to not make thing too difficult to read.  Lots of pictures and content to keep
it fun.

Check out Mike C. Frank's course on this which has some great lectures and slides

- What is [cognitive science]? * replace with the relevant course material
- Intro to Jupyter, python, and markdown
- Why learn this stuff (analysis of job listings on Monster.com or something showing python?)
- Independent versus dependent measures (including what common ones are in psychology)
- What is an experiment?  Observations/correlational data versus experiments
- Random processes, random walks, samples and their relation to the population
- WEIRD samples
- Randomized designs (block randomize, split plot)
- Stratification
- Counter balancing
- Replication crisis
- p-hacking
- HARKing
- Effect sizes
- Blinding
- Linear regression
- Correlation
- Sampling distributions
- Basic probability theory refresher?
- T-tests
- ANOVA(?)
- Signal detection theory
- Bayesian T-tests
- Multi-level models
- Making plots and figures
- Making tables
- Informed consent/Institutional review boards
- Tidy data formats

# Possible labs

- Mental Rotation
- Intiutive physics (can find the materials online perhaps?)
- Stroop (kind of boring)
- Drift diffusion reaction time?
- Reinforcement learning (like n-armed bandit)
- Choice prediction challenge dataset (big data)
- Semantic search in memory?
- baby names data?
- Speed accuracy tradeoffs
- recall versus recognition?
- Spaced versus massed practice?
- Similarity ratings and MDS (ala jess's intro)?
- Sound localization?
- visual search?
- working memory capacity
- memory decay (like acquisition and retention functions)


Considerations: 

- can you get a big enough N within a small class?
- is the phenomena robust
- does it expose an interesting but simple analysis?
- does it relate to student's lives in anyway? (e.g., how best to study?, etc...)
- does it inspire "joy"?
