<h1 id="Lab-in-Cognition-and-Perception">Lab in Cognition and Perception<a class="anchor-link" href="#Lab-in-Cognition-and-Perception"> </a></h1><p>This course provides hands-on experience with the tools and practices used in psychological research. Students learn how to use a computer to collect, analyze, and report psychological data concerning a variety aspects of human cognition and perception.  By the end of the course students will have an first hand understanding of how to run psychological experiments, collect and analyze data, and write research reports.</p>
<p>In addition to methods, the course will expose students to key concepts in cognition and perception including intelligence, learning, memory, attention, visual perception, mental imagery and imagination, and cognitive neuroscience.  Data analyzed include choice data, reaction time, eye-movement data, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).  The course culminates in an intensive final project involving the design and analysis of a novel experiment.</p>
<p>This course is useful for undergraduate students interested in getting actively involved in research at NYU or another university.  In addition, this course provides a strong background for graduate work in psychological science, particularly cognitive science, cognitive neuroscience, and perception.  Even if you plan to not continue to do scientific research, the course should arm you with some of the necessary skills to be an effective worker in a world awash with data.</p>
