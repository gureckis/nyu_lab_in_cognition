# How 

1. Basic overview of Experiment 1

---

class: light

# How do people remember?


- Remembering is so commonplace as to almost be obvious... it is our ability to use past experience to inform our current experience.

- It has long been recognized that there are really multiple forms of remembering

name: terminology
class: shortlist, middle, light


# Key terminology


- **HIT** = Human Intelligence Task (a unit of work, e.g. a trial or an entire sequence of trials in an experiment)

- .orange[**Requester**] = an entity (e.g., researcher) who posts HITs

- .blue[**Worker**] = a person who performs the task


---

class: light
# What kinds of tasks?

- Difficult for computer or machine learning systems
    - Provide three key words to describe an image
    - Does this photograph contain a car?
    - What event does this twitter search refer to?
    
- Traditional work
    - Write a positive review for this product online 
    - Translate this text from English to Spanish
    

- .green[Help with science!]
    - **Participate in my human cognition/perception/learning experiment!**


---

class: light
# Who are the workers?

- 46.80% US, 34% India, 19.20% Other

- United States demographic
    - 55-65% female
    - Most make under $60k/year
    - Median age of 30
    - Hold bachelors and are young
    - Distribution mostly similar to US internet pop.
    
- See Ipeirotis, et al. (2010) or Mason and Siddharth (2011).

# Stephanie Costello
<hr>
"Costello lives in a trailer at the edge of a desert town in the Southwest. She is 50 and has an associate?s degree in nursing, but she has been unable to find suitable work as a nurse. In 2007, Costello was working at a boring office job and, in slow periods, earning extra money by doing online surveys on Mechanical Turk. When she lost her job at the start of the 2008 recession, she took to Turking full time, often more. What started as a source of extra cash suddenly turned into her main source of income. According to the 2010 study, Costello?s situation may be representative of approximately one in eight Turkers in America, or one in five worldwide." (from [Marvit, 2014](http://www.thenation.com/article/178241/how-crowdworkers-became-ghosts-digital-machine))

class: light

# Why are people doing it?

- One word alluded to in previous passage: <b>money</b>
- Not just money but access to jobs that are open, flexible, challenging, changing, committement-free
- No travel costs, workplace politics
- For fun?  Enjoyment of mental activities?  To fill up an otherwise boring day/evening?
- For science: people generally may view participating in science studies rewarding
- "Money, and the best way to earn it, underpins much of the discussion about AMT" (on Turker Nation forum)

---
class: light


# Worth letting these point sink in...
<hr>

- Despite being a simple mouse click away, crowds are composed of **people**
- Online labor markets naturally are appealing to people without other income means
- In many ways this is **good**
- At same time risk of depersonalization due to anonymity.  These are real people and deserve respect and
thanks for participating in research

# Compensation

- Median wage is $1.38/hour

- Short tasks (~5 mins) award around 10 cents

- Requester can reject work and revoke payment

- And can also **award bonuses**

- Amazon takes 10% of payments

- Amazon tries to stay out of disputes


---


class: light
# Outside of the US

- Unfortunately, getting a requester account from outside the US can be a bit tricky

- Requires US billing address  and US debit or credit card

- If you can't get a US credit card, setting up the account with a US American collaborator is an option

- Or consider international/European alternatives to AMT, such as [clickworker](http://www.clickworker.com), [crowdflower](http://crowdflower.com). The latter actually uses AMT workers, but is accessible worldwide 

- (the psiTurk toolbox could in principle be adapted to work with other platforms)

class: light
# Why use AMT-based experiments?

- **Convenient**  And the jspsych+psiTurk toolbox will help you even more
- **Fast**  Collect a lot of data quickly, also good for piloting
- **Affordable** Workers will sign up for $2.00 for 15-25 minute session
- **Anonymous** Subject never meets experimenter
- **Replicable** Very easy to share your experiment code


---


class: light

# Why not?
Numerous concerns have been raised about AMT data:
<br>

- **Selection Bias:** No control over who takes the experiment
    - 53% are self-identified liberals, 25% conservatives, 73% voted for Obama, see details [here](http://themonkeycage.org/2012/12/19/how-representative-are-amazon-mechanical-turk-workers)
    - Makes AMT sample probably less useful for research on ideology, or political attitudes (see [this](http://www.culturalcognition.net/blog/2013/7/10/fooled-twice-shame-on-who-problems-with-mechanical-turk-stud.html) blogpost for a discussion)

    - On the other hand, 20 year old university students are a very special sample too!

- **Population size:** 
    - Amazon claims 0.5 million registered users
    - Effective population size of about 8000-10000 users

---
class:  light

# Why not?

- **Contamination of subject base** 
    - Recent [study](http://www.jessechandler.com/uploads/2/8/0/5/2805897/13_chandler_mueller__paolacci.pdf) has addressed this question
    - Can be a problem for *very* widely used paradigms 
      - 56% had participated in Prisoner's Dilemma, 52% in Ultimatum game, 30% Trolley problem

    - Cross talk (e.g. in AMT forums) seems to be rare (workers share information about payment, duration, etc.)

    - For specific studies repeated participation can be prevented by recording worker's IDs
 - .blue[PsiTurk toolbox helps with this!]

---
class: light
# Why not?
- **Non-lab setting **
    - [This](http://www.jessechandler.com/uploads/2/8/0/5/2805897/13_chandler_mueller__paolacci.pdf) study showed
      - 27% were not alone while working on the HIT
      - 18% were watching tv
      - 14% were listening to music

    - Recording how often participants change windows/take breaks might help clean data
  - .blue[PsiTurk toolbox helps with this!]

    - Still, the lack of experimental control over a worker's environment might make some studies unsuitable for AMT

# Do classic findings replicate?

- Some members of our lab recently contributed to this study that tested some classic psychology experiments on AMT.red[*]

    - Crump, M. J., McDonnell, J. V., & Gureckis, T. M. (2013). [Evaluating Amazon's Mechanical Turk as a tool for experimental behavioral research.](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0057410) PloS one, 8(3).


- Focus was on reaction time findings that require sustained attention from subjects and precise recording of responses

- And learning experiments involving more cognitive effort

# Stimulus Detection
.left-column[ 

Stroop

  - People respond faster to congruent (e.g. .blue[blue]) than to incongruent (.green[blue]) items


Task Switching

  - Faster RT if task stays the same (e.g. "Odd or Even?") than when tasks alternate ("Odd or Even?" / "Small or Large?")

Flanker

  - When identifying a target (e.g. "h"), congruent flankers ("hhhhh") lead to faster RTs than incongruent ("ffhhff") ones

# Stimulus Detection
.col1[ 

Simon

  - Targets that are spatially compatible with response key are identified faster


Visual Cuing 

  - Stimulus detection is faster for cued  versus uncued targets if cue is presented after short interval (<=300ms) and slower after longer interval (>=400ms)

Attentional Blink

  - During rapid serial visual presentation visual target detection is impaired if target is displayed 100-500ms after another one

# Subliminal Perception

Masked priming

  - Responding to arrow probes that are either compatibly (prime: >>, probe: >>) or incompatibly primed (prime: <<, probe: >>) at durations of 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, and 96 ms 

  -  Previous finding was that compatibility effects are negative for very short prime durations and positive for longer ones


  .center[
   <img src="images/PrimingResult.png" width="330">

  - Only partially replicated: no negative compatibility effect

  - Lower bound on display duration in browser! (but see, Barnhoorn et al., 2014)

# Category Learning

- Classic Shepard, Hovland, & Jenkins (1961) paper

- Six different ways of classifying the same 8 items (geometric figures with 3 binary dimensions) into deterministic categories

- Generally Type I is learned faster than Type II which is faster that Types III-V, with Type VI the hardest

# Replication in other Areas

1. Clinical (Shapiro, et al, 2013)

  - Scores on a range of psychometric tests had high internal consistency and test-retest reliability  (r =.87)

2. Personality (Buhrmeser, et al, 2011)

  - No difference in consistency on personality questionnaires at different payment levels, and absolute levels of consistency and test-retest reliability were high (r = .88)

3. JDM (Paolacci, et al, 2010)
  
  -  Compared classic JDM studies (Asian Disease, Linda, Physicians Problem) on AMT and university subject pool
  - No difference in failure rate of catch trials and pattern of behavior in studies but AMT subjects were more risk averse

# A word on Ethics

- How much should you pay?  
    - As much as the market supports or should it match what you pay in the lab (roughly)?
    - AMT has been criticized for incentivizing companies to outsource labor without adequate compensation (for discussions see for example [here](http://priceonomics.com/who-makes-below-minimum-wage-in-the-mechanical/?utm_source=buffer&utm_campaign=Buffer&utm_content=buffer2d486&utm_medium=twitter), [here](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/the-unregulated-work-of-mechanical-turk/), and [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julian-dobson/mechanical-turk-amazons-underclass_b_2687431.html))

- Can you get IRB approval for your experiment?
    - Arguably, workers have more freedom of choice than lab participants (can stop experiment any time)
    - Wasn't very difficult to add to an existing IRB at NYU
    - Common at many, many universities now.

# Be a good requester
- If your task breaks, workers *will* e-mail you!

- They also share information about good and bad requesters:

# Be a good requester
 
A few recommendations to keep workers happy...

1. Before running, .blue[test your experiment] on different browsers and the sandbox (AMT's testing environment)

1. Give explicit instructions and .blue[show warnings] about closing the page, going back in the browsers, etc.

1. Start collecting data in .blue[small batches]
 
1. If something goes wrong, provide an .blue[alternative payment method] for workers who are unable to finish or submit HIT
    - One way of doing this is to provide a HIT with no content specifically aimed at workers that had problems and pay them using a "bonus"

class: light
# Summary

1. AMT  allows you to collect data quickly and conveniently

1. Web experiments can prevent experimenter effects and increase anonymity

1. Many classic psychology findings replicate with high fidelity
    - But  it's important to check for browser limits regarding presentation time, etc.

    - It's also helpful to check participants' understanding of the task

1. Changing payment does not have a large effect performance but does affect signup and dropout rates

1. Make sure to build up a good reputation with AMT workers to make your life easier

    
<!-- - Note: dropout rates are much higher than in the lab, so maybe consider reporting those if they might interact with performance
