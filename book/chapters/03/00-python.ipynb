    "One of the best features of Python, and one reason contributing to its popularity is the large number of add on packages.  For example, there are packages for data analysis (`pandas`), plotting (`matplotlib` or `seaborn`), etc...  These packages are not all loaded automatically.  Instead at the start of your notebook or program, you often need to **import** this functionality.  There are a couple of ways to import packages.  Generally you need to know the name of the package and details about what functions or methods it provides.  Most packages have tons of great documentation.  For example, `pandas` a library we will use a lot in class has extensive documentation on the [pydata website](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/). "

If we type `import pandas` that will load the library but that means everytime we use a pandas function it will need to begin with the `pandas.<something>` syntax.  This can be a lot of typing.  As a result many popular packages are imported using the `import <package> as <shortname>` syntax.
