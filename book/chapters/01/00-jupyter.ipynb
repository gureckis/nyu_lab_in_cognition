    "Doing statistical data analysis using computer scripts written by the researcher is better than point-and-click interfaces such as SPSS that you might be familiar with.  If you use a point-and-click interface you have to write down the exact sequence of steps and even take screen-shots of the interface to help someone else perform the same analysis [^SPSS].  This can lead to bugs and mistakes which hurt the progress of science.  In contrast, if your analysis is written in a programming language of some type, the sequence of commands  can easily be shared between researchers.  Running the sequence of instructions (also referred to as \"code\") will allow anyone to repeat the same analysis and check it is correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "[^SPSS]: Note that some point and click analysis programs do allow some types of scripting.  However, the primary way people use and are taught these tools is through the graphical interface (in fact this is primarily why these programs are popular!)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, writing such code is often kind of limited.  Usually computer programs are entered into the computer using a plain text editor (similar to Notepad on the PC or TextEdit on the Mac).  This editor cannot display colors (sometimes) and usually also cannot display other types of media like figures, images, tables, movies, interactive animations, and so forth.  This makes code somewhat lifeless and also means that any outputs of the code that are  media have to be stored separately.  For example, if your analysis script outputs a graph, that graph will be saved to a different file and becomes \"detached\" the code that generated it.  This can make it hard to keep track of outputs and can lead to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"notebook\" interface is an approach to a programming and data analysis which combines programming/analysis code with text, images, figure, animations, and other multimedia in the same document (see {numref}`Figure {number} <jupyternotebook>`).   The idea for computational notebooks has been around for a long time (e.g., [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) is a commercial product that has long provided a notebook interface for data analysis and programming).  However, Jupyter is now one of the leading tools thatscientists, including psychological scientists, use to analyze their data and write code.\n",

    "3. Jupyter runs in a standard webbrowser.  This means you can use Jupyter often on any computing device you like including low-cost laptops like Chromebooks/Netbooks or even a tablet like an iPad.\n",

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The key to Jupyter is the concept of a **computational notebook**.  A computational notebook is a document-based approach to structuring data analysis and programming.  A notebook appears and acts similar to other programs you are familiar with like Excel or Google Sheets (spreadsheets) or Word or Google Docs (word processor).  These programs provide ways for you to enter information into documents and to save those file, send them to others, copy-paste, text, alter the formatting, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "We will primarily use the \"classic\" Jupyter Notebook interface which consists of a single document which you interact with not unlike a word processor.  There is a newer interface called [JupyterLab](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906) which looks more like Matlab or RStudio's interface allowing multiple windows and views of the running code.  The traditional notebook interface is prefered here primarily because it simple and faciliates reading along.\n",
    "\n",
    "A computational notebook typically is made up of a set of elements called \"cells\" that group little bits of information together.  A notebook document (usually ending with the .ipynb extension on the file name) is a list of cells arranged from the top of the document to the bottom.  Cells can contain several types of information including code, text, images and so forth.  You develop your project by creating new cells, entering information, reordering cells, and saving the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key element which makes a notebook \"computational\" is that it can be linked to a computing engine known as a \"kernel\" which can run on the same computer or another computer using the Internet.  The kernel is separate from the notebook and can for instance be stopped and started independently from the program displaying the notebook itself. The magic happens when a cell is \"executed.\"  This sounds scary but refers simply to making the code in the cell \"go\".  When this happens the code from the cell that was executed is sent to the computational kernel and this kernel will run the sequence of commands contained within the cell.  Any results such as figures or printouts from the results of that code running will be sent to the notebook from the kernel and will be inserted beneath the cell which was just executed.  A diagram of the basic conceptual idea is shown in {numref}`Figure {number} <jupyterflow>`.\n",

    "One somewhat confusing aspect of Jupyter for beginners is that the notebook is simply a way to organize information and the order of information in a notebook has nothing to do with the order in which code has been executed on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, each time you execute a cell, the commands from that cell are sent to the kernel, run, and then returned.  Usually it make sense to organize your code so that multiple cells are arranged in order from the top of the document to the bottom.  You would then execute the first cell, then the second cell, and so forth. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, **and this is really important**, you don't have to execute the cells in order.  You can execute the third cell before the second or first cell if you want.  This just means that the code in the third cell would be sent to the kernel first and then the other cells would be sent.  This means that the order of the cells in the notebook document are really just for presentation, and it is up to you to \"run/execute\" the cells in whatever order you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is mostly helpful because when you are doing and analysis you might want to go back up to the top and change something and then continue where you left off.  To do that you could scroll back to a earlier cell, change it, then execute it and then go back down to the beginning of the script.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, things can get confusing.  If you delete a cell it doesn't mean the code was \"undone\".  The kernel doesn't know anything about any edits you make to the notebook interface.  All it does is receive code when you send it via the \"execute cell\" command and then it waits.  This can mean that the \"state\" or current status of the kernel can at times be different from what your cells or notebook look like.  One easy option to deal with this is that if things get too far out of wack you can simply restart the kernel.  This will erase it's current state and set it back to a fresh start.  However, then you need to re-execute all of the cells in your notebook to get back to where you were.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best analogy is like telling your friend how to cook a meal for you over the phone.  You have the instructions in front of you (your notebook) and you tell your friend (the kernel) what to do.  If you read the instructions out of order your friend can't tell the difference.  They just know each step you told them to do and follow it.  It is up to you to direct the instructions so they arrive to your friend (the kernel) in the right order.  And of course if things get confused you can just tell your friend to start over from stratch and begin again.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first this can be confusing but eventually you get the hang of it.  It is one source of bugs/errors in Jupyter programming though and some people don't like using Jupyter for that reason.  In our case the upsides overweight this awkwardness.\n",
