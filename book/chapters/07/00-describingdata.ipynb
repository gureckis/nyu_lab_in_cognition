    "This chapter by [Todd M. Gureckis](https://gureckislab.org/~gureckis) and is released under the [license for this book](../../LICENSE). Elements of this chapter are adapted from Matthew Crump's excellent [Answering questions with data](https://crumplab.github.io/statistics/) book {cite}`Crump2019` which also draws from from Danielle Navarro's excellent [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com) book {cite}`Navarro2011`.  One major change is the code was adapted to use python and jupyter.  In addition the introduction was replaced/shortened.  A chapter on descriptive statistics and correlation were merged.\n",

    "We previously considered ways to visualize data using computer graphics.  Visualizations help us see patterns in data and to verify our understanding.  Visualization also sometimes help to summarize data in a more compact form than looking at the raw data.  However, in some cases it is more precise to summarize our data using numbers which we call **descriptive statistics**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics are probably the simplest and most straightforward aspect of statistical data analysis.  We are simplying taking a collection of numbers and computing a new number which summarizes the data in some way.  There are many different descriptive statistics and which is most appropriate depends a lot on the nature of the data and what you want to communicate about the data to others.  Simply put, a descriptive statistic is a number, computed on a collection of numbers (i.e., data), that captures something important about the data.  \n",

    "    <img src=\"./images/descriptivestats.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic papers in psychology are littered with descriptive statitics even if inferential statistics (things we will discuss later) end up being the \"flashiest\" findings.  We need descriptive statistics to tell readers of our papers or audience members at our talks/posters what basically went on in a dataset without showing them all of the data or giving too many plots/visualizations.  Descriptive statistics tend to be quick, easy to convey summaries.  In addition, since they are usually numbers, they admit easy comparison to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of different descriptive statistics.  The one you are perhaps most familiar with is the arithmetic average or _mean_ (e.g., when you compute your average grade for the class it summarizes your performance in the class across many different assignments).  However there are many others we will discuss, and it fact it is possible to compute new statistics yourself!  \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the statistical concepts in this chapter should be review if you have taken an introductory statistics course in psychology.  What you will learn by reading carefully is how to easily compute descriptive statistics for different datasets using Python and Pandas, a review of the merits and meaning of various statistics, and how to report them in papers and talks."

    "The data is from the [OMNI](http://gureckislab.org/omni/index.html) project which examines how people learn and forget information.  In this specific dataset a set of participants studied a list of 45 Lithuanian-English vocabulary words five times for each word.  Immediately after study, participant gave each word pair a \"judgement-of-learning\" (JOL) rating of how likely they felt they would remember this pair at a later test.  They then came back for a test session several hours later (depending on a between-subject condition) and were presented with the Lithuanian word of each pair and asked to type in the corresponding English word.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **mode** is the most frequently occurring number in your measurement. That is it. How do you find it? You have to count the number of times each number appears in your measure, then whichever one occurs the most, is the mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 6\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode of the above set is 1, which occurs three times. Every other number only occurs once.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK fine. What happens here:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 4 5 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm, now 1 and 2 both occur three times each. What do we do? We say there are two modes, and they are 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is the mode a measure of central tendency? Well, when we ask, \"what are my numbers like\", we can say, \"most of the number are, like a 1 (or whatever the mode is)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the mode a good measure of central tendency? That depends on your numbers. For example, consider these numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the mode is 1 again, because there are two 1s, and all of the other numbers occur once. But, are most of the numbers like, a 1. No, they are mostly not 1s. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When is the mode a good summary of a set of data?  Well generally mode is useful for things that have a chance of repeating.  For instance since we usually think of people's age in whole numbers (36, 24, 56, etc...) then we can find the modal age to find the most common age.  However, it might make less sense on more fine-grained measurements.  For instance if you recorded the altitude of every US city to the closest millimeter it might not make sense to report the mode since at the scale of a millimeter maybe very few cities have the same value (and thus there are many modes with only one occurence).  As the podcast above points out the mode is good for gauging \"who is most common/typical in a population\" and that is why talking about the \"modal american\" is an appealing statistical concept."

    "Knowing how to calculate means and medians is only a part of the story. You also need to understand what each one is saying about the data, and what that implies for when you should use each one. This is illustrated in {numref}`fig:meanmedian` the mean is kind of like the \"centre of gravity\" of the data set, whereas the median is the \"middle value\" in the data. What this implies, as far as which one you should use, depends a little on what type of data you've got and what you're trying to achieve. As a rough guide:\n",
    " \n",
    "- If your data are nominal scale, you probably shouldn't be using either the mean or the median. Both the mean and the median rely on the idea that the numbers assigned to values are meaningful. If the numbering scheme is arbitrary, then it's probably best to use the mode instead. \n",
    "- If your data are ordinal scale, you're more likely to want to use the median than the mean. The median only makes use of the order information in your data (i.e., which numbers are bigger), but doesn't depend on the precise numbers involved. That's exactly the situation that applies when your data are ordinal scale. The mean, on the other hand, makes use of the precise numeric values assigned to the observations, so it's not really appropriate for ordinal data.\n",
    "- For interval and ratio scale data, either one is generally acceptable. Which one you pick depends a bit on what you're trying to achieve. The mean has the advantage that it uses all the information in the data (which is useful when you don't have a lot of data), but it's very sensitive to extreme values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's expand on that last part a little. One consequence is that there's systematic differences between the mean and the median when the histogram is asymmetric (also known as \"skewed\"). This is illustrated in {numref}`fig:meanmedian` notice that the median (right hand side) is located closer to the \"body\" of the histogram, whereas the mean (left hand side) gets dragged towards the \"tail\" (where the extreme values are). To give a concrete example, suppose Bob (income \\$50,000), Kate (income \\$60,000) and Jane (income \\$65,000) are sitting at a table: the average income at the table is \\$58,333 and the median income is \\$60,000. Then Bill sits down with them (income \\$100,000,000). The average income has now jumped to \\$25,043,750 but the median rises only to \\$62,500. If you're interested in looking at the overall income at the table, the mean might be the right answer; but if you're interested in what counts as a typical income at the table, the median would be a better choice here."

Now imagine I want to define a new variable $Z$ that is the sum of the two, $Z = X+Y$. As it turns out, the variance of $Z$ is equal to $\\mbox{Var}(X) + \\mbox{Var}(Y)$. This is a *very* useful property, but it's not true of the other measures that I talk about in this section.\n",

The variance of a data set $X$ is sometimes written as $\\mbox{Var}(X)$, but it's more commonly denoted $s^2$ (the reason for this will become clearer shortly).

    "So *why* Python is dividing by $N-1$ and not by $N$. After all, the variance is supposed to be the *mean* squared deviation, right? So shouldn't we be dividing by $N$, the actual number of observations in the sample? Well, yes, we should. However, as we'll discuss in an [upcoming chapter](../../chapters/08/02-estimation.html), there's a subtle distinction between \"describing a sample\" and \"making guesses about the population from which the sample came\". Up to this point, it's been a distinction without a difference. Regardless of whether you're describing a sample or drawing inferences about the population, the mean is calculated exactly the same way. Not so for the variance, or the standard deviation, or for many other measures besides. What I outlined to you initially (i.e., take the actual average, and thus divide by $N$) assumes that you literally intend to calculate the variance of the sample. Most of the time, however, you're not terribly interested in the sample *in and of itself*. Rather, the sample exists to tell you something about the world. If so, you're actually starting to move away from calculating a \"sample statistic\", and towards the idea of estimating a \"population parameter\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, one last thing. This section so far has read a bit like a mystery novel. I've shown you how to calculate the variance, described the weird \"$N-1$\" thing that Pandas does and hinted at the reason why it's there, but I haven't mentioned the single most important thing... how do you *interpret* the variance? Descriptive statistics are supposed to describe things, after all, and right now the variance is really just a gibberish number. Unfortunately, the reason why I haven't given you the human-friendly interpretation of the variance is that there really isn't one. This is the most serious problem with the variance. Although it has some elegant mathematical properties that suggest that it really is a fundamental quantity for expressing variation, it's completely useless if you want to communicate with an actual human... variances are completely uninterpretable in terms of the original variable! All the numbers have been squared, and they don't mean anything anymore. This is a huge issue. For instance, according to the table I presented earlier, the margin in game 1 was \"376.36 points-squared higher than the average margin\". This is *exactly* as stupid as it sounds; and so when we calculate a variance of 324.64, we're in the same situation. I've watched a lot of footy games, and never has anyone referred to \"points squared\". It's *not* a real unit of measurement, and since the variance is expressed in terms of this gibberish unit, it is totally meaningless to a human."

    "### Standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, suppose that you like the idea of using the variance because of those nice mathematical properties that I haven't talked about, but -- since you're a human and not a robot -- you'd like to have a measure that is expressed in the same units as the data itself (i.e., points, not points-squared). What should you do? The solution to the problem is obvious: take the square root of the variance, known as the **_standard deviation_**, also called the \"root mean squared deviation\", or RMSD. This solves our problem fairly neatly: while nobody has a clue what \"a variance of 324.68 points-squared\" really means, it's much easier to understand \"a standard deviation of 18.01 points\", since it's expressed in the original units. It is traditional to refer to the standard deviation of a sample of data as $s$, though \"sd\" and \"std dev.\" are also used at times. Because the standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance, you probably won't be surprised to see that the formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$s = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2 }$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the Python function that we use to calculate it is `std()`. However, as you might have guessed from our discussion of the variance, what Python actually calculates is slightly different to the formula given above. Just like the we saw with the variance, what Python calculates is a version that divides by $N-1$ rather than $N$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2 }\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Range*. Gives you the full spread of the data. It's very vulnerable to outliers, and as a consequence it isn't often used unless you have good reasons to care about the extremes in the data.\n",
    "- *Interquartile range*. Tells you where the \"middle half\" of the data sits. It's pretty robust, and complements the median nicely. This is used a lot.\n",
    "- *Variance*. Tells you the average squared deviation from the mean. It's mathematically elegant, and is probably the \"right\" way to describe variation around the mean, but it's completely uninterpretable because it doesn't use the same units as the data. Almost never used except as a mathematical tool; but it's buried \"under the hood\" of a very large number of statistical tools.\n",
    "- *Standard deviation*. This is the square root of the variance. It's fairly elegant mathematically, and it's expressed in the same units as the data so it can be interpreted pretty well. In situations where the mean is the measure of central tendency, this is the default. This is by far the most popular measure of variation. \n",

They are compressed summaries of large piles of numbers. They will almost always be unable to represent all of the numbers fairly. There are also different kinds of descriptive statistics that you could use, and it sometimes not clear which one's you should use. \n",

For instance remember the discussion from the previous chapter on [Anscombe's Quartet](../../chapters/06/00-plots.html#why-create-visualizations) where we were arguing that visualization provide an important check on the validity of various quantitative summaries of data {cite}`Anscombe1973`.  It is up to you to check that your descriptive statistics reflect the data in a faithful way.

    "So far we have mostly examined how to apply descriptive statistics to the entire column of a dataframe.  However, often we want to apply descriptive statistics to smaller groups of data.  For instance consider the `recall_accuracy` column of the OMNI dataset we have been exploring in this chapter.  This is a 0/1 column coding if the person got a particular word correct at test.  Although we could computed the `.mean()` on this column to find the average accuracy of the entire group of subjects there are several reasons we might not find that as useful.  First is that there are different participants in the dataset and we might be interested in the range of individual performances in the task.  In addition, there was an experimental condition: delay between study and test.  If you compute the mean of the entire `recall_accuracy` column, we will be obscuring how study-test delay might be influencing performance by putting all the data into one summary.  \n",

The first thing to recognize is that this command combines several steps using **chaining** where multiuple methods are computed in a sequence in a single line strung together by dots (`.`).  The first step does a `.groupby()` on the `delay_group` column.  If you remember from our earlier discussion of grouping this will form groups where each group contains all the rows that share the same value on the `delay_group` column (meaning were in the same condition).  Next you see the column indexing operation `['recall_accuracy']` which means we just pulled out the accuracy column.  Then we use `.mean()` to summarize the groups.  This results not in one mean but serveral, one for each group.  As we can see performance was highest in the A group which was the immediate test condition.  Performance was low (~23\\%) in the E and H groups which were 48 hours or more of delay."

    "Of course, one of the most important transformation is to find the accuracy per-subject (since subjects are often our unit of analysis).  In this case we might like to compute the average performance of each person but copy over several of the other attributes such as the condition.  For this we are going to use a more complex command called [named aggregation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#named-aggregation) which results in a new dataframe that is \"tidy\" in the sense of each row being an observation (person) and each column being a descriptor or variable but we got rid of the individual trials here and replaced them with the average across the trials.  This is a very common type of step in behavior data analysis."

    "In addition to the standard statistics like mean, median, variance, etc... it is possible to compute custom descriptive statistics on your data.  This sometimes comes up in the context of a psychology experiment where something like \"proportion of learning blocks where people reached some criterion\" might be your statistic.  In those cases you might need to write a custom definition of a statistic and apply it to your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do this in Pandas is with the `.apply()` function (docs [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#flexible-apply)).  Let's look at an example by using `.apply()` to compute a custom variation measure called the mean absolute deviation.  This is related to the mean squared deviation used in the normal variance but instead of squaring the numbers we take their absolute value."

    "### The correlation coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make these ideas a bit more explicit by introducing the idea of a **_correlation coefficient_** (or, more specifically, Pearson's correlation coefficient), which is traditionally denoted by $r$. The correlation coefficient between two variables $X$ and $Y$ (sometimes denoted $r_{XY}$), which we'll define more precisely in the next section, is a measure that varies from $-1$ to $1$. When $r = -1$ it means that we have a perfect negative relationship, and when $r = 1$ it means we have a perfect positive relationship. When $r = 0$, there's no relationship at all. If you look at {numref}`fig:corr`, you can see several plots showing what different correlations look like."

    "The formula for the Pearson's correlation coefficient can be written in several different ways. I think the simplest way to write down the formula is to break it into two steps. Firstly, let's introduce the idea of a **_covariance_**. The covariance between two variables $X$ and $Y$ is a generalization of the notion of the variance; it's a mathematically simple way of describing the relationship between two variables that isn't terribly informative to humans:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\mbox{Cov}(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right) \\left( Y_i - \\bar{Y} \\right)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we're multiplying (i.e., taking the \"product\" of) a quantity that depends on $X$ by a quantity that depends on $Y$ and then averaging [^covariance], you can think of the formula for the covariance as an \"average cross product\" between $X$ and $Y$. The covariance has the nice property that, if $X$ and $Y$ are entirely unrelated, then the covariance is exactly zero. If the relationship between them is positive (in the sense shown in {numref}`fig:corr`) then the covariance is also positive; and if the relationship is negative then the covariance is also negative. In other words, the covariance captures the basic qualitative idea of correlation. Unfortunately, the raw magnitude of the covariance isn't easy to interpret: it depends on the units in which $X$ and $Y$ are expressed, and worse yet, the actual units that the covariance itself is expressed in are really weird. For instance, if $X$ refers to the `jol_value` variable (units: rating points on a judgement) and $Y$ refers to the `recall_accuracy` variable (units: proportion accurate), then the units for their covariance are \"rating points $\\times$ accuracy\". And I have no freaking idea what that would even mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "[^covariance]: Just like we saw with the variance and the standard deviation, in practice we divide by $N-1$ rather than $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient $r$ fixes this interpretation problem by standardizing the covariance, in pretty much the exact same way that the $z$-score standardizes a raw score: by dividing by the standard deviation. However, because we have two variables that contribute to the covariance, the standardization only works if we divide by both standard deviations [^corsimple].  In other words, the correlation between $X$ and $Y$ can be written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "r_{XY}  = \\frac{\\mbox{Cov}(X,Y)}{ \\hat{\\sigma}_X \\ \\hat{\\sigma}_Y}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this standardization, not only do we keep all of the nice properties of the covariance discussed earlier, but the actual values of $r$ are on a meaningful scale: $r= 1$ implies a perfect positive relationship, and $r = -1$ implies a perfect negative relationship. I'll expand a little more on this point later. But before I do, let's look at how to calculate correlations in R.\n",

    "### Calculating correlations in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods for computing the correlation coefficient in Python including using [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.pearsonr.html), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.corrcoef.html), and [Pandas](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.corrcoef.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually one is interested in just the regular correlation coefficient, $r$, which is easy to do with Scipy's `pearsonr` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "import scipy.stats as stats\n",
    "stats.pearsonr( x = corr_df['jol_value'], y = corr_df['recall_accuracy'] )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You simply specify the vector of numbers to use as x and y and the function returns a tuple. The first is the pearson $r$ value and the second is the $p$-value from a hypothesis test that the correlation coefficient is greater than 0 (a future chapter will go more deeply into the logic of hypothesis testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is also a `corr()` function available as a dataframe method in Pandsa that is a bit more powerful than this simple example suggests. For example, you can also calculate a complete \"correlation matrix\", between all pairs of variables in the data frame:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### Interpreting a correlation\n",
    " \n",
    "Naturally, in real life you don't see many correlations of 1. So how should you interpret a correlation of, say $r= .4$? The honest answer is that it really depends on what you want to use the data for, and on how strong the correlations in your field tend to be. A friend of mine in engineering once argued that any correlation less than $.95$ is completely useless (I think he was exaggerating, even for engineering). On the other hand there are real cases -- even in psychology -- where you should really expect correlations that strong. For instance, one of the benchmark data sets used to test theories of how people judge similarities is so clean that any theory that can't achieve a correlation of at least $.9$ really isn't deemed to be successful. However, when looking for (say) elementary correlates of intelligence (e.g., inspection time, response time), if you get a correlation above $.3$ you're doing very very well. In short, the interpretation of a correlation depends a lot on the context. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, something that can never be stressed enough is that you should *always* look at the scatterplot before attaching any interpretation to the data. A correlation might not mean what you think it means (see above)."

    "### Spearman's rank correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient is useful for a lot of things, but it does have shortcomings. One issue in particular stands out: what it actually measures is the strength of the *linear* relationship between two variables. In other words, what it gives you is a measure of the extent to which the data all tend to fall on a single, perfectly straight line. Often, this is a pretty good approximation to what we mean when we say \"relationship\", and so the Pearson correlation is a good thing to calculation. Sometimes, it isn't. \n",
    "\n",
    "One very common situation where the Pearson correlation isn't quite the right thing to use arises when an increase in one variable $X$ really is reflected in an increase in another variable $Y$, but the nature of the relationship isn't necessarily linear. An example of this might be the relationship between effort and reward when studying for an exam. If you put in zero effort ($X$) into learning a subject, then you should expect a grade of 0% ($Y$). However, a little bit of effort will cause a *massive* improvement: just turning up to lectures means that you learn a fair bit, and if you just turn up to classes, and scribble a few things down so your grade might rise to 35%, all without a lot of effort. However, you just don't get the same effect at the other end of the scale. As everyone knows, it takes *a lot* more effort to get a grade of 90% than it takes to get a grade of 55%. What this means is that, if I've got data looking at study effort and grades, there's a pretty good chance that Pearson correlations will be misleading. \n",

    "but this doesn't actually capture the observation that increasing hours worked *always* increases the grade. There's a sense here in which we want to be able to say that the correlation is *perfect* but for a somewhat different notion of what a \"relationship\" is. What we're looking for is something that captures the fact that there is a perfect **_ordinal relationship_** here. That is, if student 1 works more hours than student 2, then we can guarantee that student 1 will get the better grade. That's not what a correlation of $r = .91$ says at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "How should we address this? Actually, it's really easy: if we're looking for ordinal relationships, all we have to do is treat the data as if it were ordinal scale! So, instead of measuring effort in terms of \"hours worked\", lets rank all 10 of our students in order of hours worked. That is, student 1 did the least work out of anyone (2 hours) so they get the lowest rank (rank = 1). Student 4 was the next laziest, putting in only  6 hours of work in over the whole semester, so they get the next lowest rank (rank = 2). Notice that I'm using \"rank =1\" to mean \"low rank\". Sometimes in everyday language we talk about \"rank = 1\" to mean \"top rank\" rather than \"bottom rank\". So be careful: you can rank \"from smallest value to largest value\" (i.e., small equals rank 1) or you can rank \"from largest value to smallest value\" (i.e., large equals rank 1). In this case, I'm ranking from smallest to largest, because that's the default way that Python does it. But in real life, it's really easy to forget which way you set things up, so you have to put a bit of effort into remembering! \n",
