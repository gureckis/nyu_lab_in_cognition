    "Congratulations! You made it through **Lab in Cognition and Perception**.  Hopefully you learned some new skills as well as got to know more about psychological research in cognition, perception, and cognitive science.  At the end of the semester, I frequently get requests from students looking for what they can do in the future to continue to develop their skills. The good news is that in this course you learned a little bit of Python programming and this opens up and world of fun things you can play with and learn."

There are several resources for learning more about cognitive science.\n",

Most faculty have a website which lists their publications, and reading these papers can be an excellent way to familiarize yourself with the field.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. A Masters (MA) degree.  A MA degree is typically a two year program which gives graduate training in a field.  NYU has two very relevant MA programs for students who enjoyed this class.  One is the NYU Psychology [MA program](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/departments/psychology/graduate/ma-psychology.html) which has a focus for Cognition/Perception and Neuroscience among other subfields.  In addition the NYU Center for Data Science [MA program](https://cds.nyu.edu/masters-program/) is one of the most selective and successful programs in Data Science in the world.\n",
    "1. A Phd degree: For those that really have passion and who earned a top grade in the class I might expect a PhD could be well suited.  A PhD will spend a lot of time working on data analysis and exploring the topics we covered in class.  There isn't enough room here to give a full summary of what is required to consider a PhD but happy to chat about it."
