    "In this chapter we will turn to an introduction to neuroimaging data and specifically to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). \n",
    "\n",
    "Functional MRI is an important tool in contemporary psychological research. The development of MRI scanners that can take advantage of nuclear magnetic resonance to peer inside the human body as it lives and acts is a staggering achievement of human ingenuity, involving decades of work from physicists, engineers, radiologists, neuroscientists, and statisticians.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we will spend some time in this section learning about how MRI scanners work and the physiological basis of the Blood Oxygenation Level Depending (BOLD) signal that is usually measured in fMRI experiments, our primary focus will be on applying and what we have learned in previous chapters to a new kind of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "A psychologist or cognitive neuroscientist considering an fMRI experiment is faced with a task that is becoming familiar to us: what kinds of questions can be asked with these data and by what techniques can we obtain satisfactory answers?  Building on previous chapters we will find ourselves with large amounts of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functional MRI measures the signal level from thousands of locations in the brain at repeating times throughout the course of an experiment and our goal is to understand how that signal relates to cognitive and perceptual processing. At the core of our endeavor is the goal of understanding or explaining how a measured outcome -- the signal change over time -- is related to known aspects of the experiment like the timing of stimulus presentation or the observed behavior of a participant.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this goal we can turn to a familiar friend: regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous chapters we learned how to quantify the relationship (the *correlation* or *covariation*) between two sets of observations. We also learned how to conduct a regression analysis to assess whether a *predictor* variable like amount of sleep each night could explain the variation in another variable like the amount of grumpiness each day. Doing this involved finding the best values for $B_1$ and $B_0$ so that we could minimize the residual error $\\epsilon$ in the regression equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = b_1 X + b_0 + \\epsilon\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Y$ was a vector of outcome measurements (grumpiness) and $X$ was a vector of possible predictor values (amount of sleep). \n",
    "\n",
    "The *best fitting line* reflects the relationship between $X$ and $Y$ and the optimal values of $b_1$ and $b_0$ for a particular regression model (i.e., for a particular set of input and output measurements) are those values that when combined with the values in $X$ produce a set of predicted data values $\\hat{Y}_i$ whose summed difference from the true values in $y$ is minimized."

Measuring this chacteristic move back into alignment with the primary magnetic field is the basis of MRI measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key to MRI is the knowledge that different kinds of atomic nuclei have different *resonant frequencies*. This knowledge guides the choise of RF pulse frequency described above, allowing researchers to target different kinds of materials. The resonant frequency is also known as the [Larmor frequency](https://www.mr-tip.com/serv1.php?type=db1&dbs=Larmor%20Frequency) and is given by the Larmor equation $f_0 = \\gamma B_0$ with $\\gamma$ corresponding to the gyromagnetic ratio and $B_0$ the strength of the magnetic field. The gyromagnetic ratio is different for different kinds of atomic nuclei (e.g. Hydrogen vs Helium vs Carbon) and these values are known.\n",

    "Combining the known gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$ with the known magnet strength $B_0$, a resonant frequency can be chosen to target a specific kind of atom. By introducing energy into the system at that frequency and then measuring the release of that energy an MRI scanner can record how much of that kind of atom was present at the time of the measurement. This procedure is repeated for many locations in the 3D space occupied by the object being scanned, resulting in a 3D image where each *voxel*, or 3D pixel, has an intensity corresponding to the measurement just described.\n",

The BOLD signal derives from changes in the oxygen level of blood that are related to neural activity. Although the spatial resolution of fMRI is much worse than structural MRI, fMRI measures a signal that changes from moment to moment as neural activity waxes and wanes and so it provides an indirect measurement of neural activity over time.\n",

    "The data obtained from these two types of scans differ in several ways. Structural MRI results in a single ***volume*** which is the 3D box corresponding to the area scanned by the MRI machine. This volume is composed of individual ***voxels*** which are like three-dimensional pixels (the green and blue boxes in the image above). Voxels are the basic spatial unit of measurement in MRI and in structural MRI like the image above they are usually around 1mm x 1mm x 1mm. The MRI machine measures one number per voxel, and in structural MRI there is a single volume because we do not expect the anatomy to change across the timescale of the scanning session. This results in a three-dimensional dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional MRI data also contains volumes composed of individual voxels. In fMRI these voxels tend to be in the size range of 3mm x 3mm x 3mm, but unlike structural MRI we get a measurement from each voxel at each timestep of the experiment. The unit of time in MRI is a ***TR*** (time to repetition) which is the time it takes to make a single measurement from each voxel in the volume. In fMRI this is usually in the range of 1 to 3 seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to structural MRI which is measuring signal that distinguishes different tissue types from each other, fMRI is measuring the BOLD signal which changes at each moment in time in response to nearby neural activity. This means an fMRI dataset is four-dimensional, containing a volume of $N$ voxels measured at each of $T$ timepoints. Then, for each voxel (corresponding to an $x,y,z$ coordinate in the 3D volume) there is a timeseries of BOLD activation measured during the course of the experiment.\n"

The key to BOLD imaging is the insight that the magnetic properties of blood change depending on the level of oxygen in the blood and that the level of oxygen in a given quantity of blood is related to metabolic activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "For brain imaging this enables an indirect measurement of neural activity because neural activity is *very* energy dependent, requiring ATP for ion transport channels at the synapse level. Blood vessels innervate the brain in order to support these energy needs by delivering oxygen to facililtate ATP production. Neural activity causes consumption of oxygen from the blood in the immediate area of the active neurons. This causes a change to the magnetic properties of that blood. This is followed by an increase of oxygenated blood flowing into the area, leading to further changes in the magnetic properties of the blood. These changing mangetic properties of blood associated with neural activity are the changes in BOLD signal we measure over time for each voxel.\n",

But if you look closely at the figure you might also notice that there is a delay between the onset of a visual stimulus (like at timepoint 60) and the rise in signal intensity measured in the brain. This delay looks to be on the order of seconds, but we know that neurons in the visual cortex respond to visual stimulation within milliseconds of it appearing on the retina.\n",

    "The HRF is the timecourse of BOLD activation in response to a brief neural event. It was originally derived empirically as the measured BOLD response in visual cortex to a brief *impulse* of stimulation: researchers flashed extremely brief visual stimulation which is known to lead to action potentials in primary visual cortex (V1) within milliseconds of stimulus onset and this neural activity stops when the visual input stops. By measuring the BOLD response in visual cortex in response to this visual stimulation researchers determined that neural activity leads to BOLD signal that has a characteristic shape and timing.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you look back at the visual stimulation experiment figure and focus on the line indicating \"on\" for a stimulus and then look at the shape of the rising signal intensity during that period you'll see that it looks similar to our HRF schematic here where the stimulus onset is followed several seconds later by a slow rise to the peak response."
