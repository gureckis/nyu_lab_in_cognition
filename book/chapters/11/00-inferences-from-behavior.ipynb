    "The last few chapters have provided a review and update to your understanding of statistical analysis.  However, lets not lose sight of what we are analyzing and why.  In cognitive science, the goal is to understand the way the mind works.  However, we can only do this typically by observing the behavior of a person.  The goal of experimental approaches to behavior is to record how people behave in different circumstances and to infer from that aspect of how their mind must be functioning. \n",

    "In this chapter we are just going to step through some of the different measurements of behavior commonly used in research into human cognition and perception.  Our goal in this review is to make sure everyone is aware of these different measures, what they are good for, discuss some of the technical issues with the measure, and some of the issues in analysis and interpretation of these measures.  Generally when doing research projects researchers spend a lot of time discussing with their students and colleagues the best behavioral measures to use for the task at hand and so creatively using these measures is an important part of the scientific process.  The list we consider here is not comprehensive but gives a general overview of many of the most common measurement approaches."
