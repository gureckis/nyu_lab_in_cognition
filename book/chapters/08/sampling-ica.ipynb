One is to randomly select subset of test-training if we are doing machine learning projects on the data (we'll talk about this later).  Another is if there are two many records to analyze so it makes sense to randomly select a subset and analyze those.  Another is to repeatedly sample over and over again from a dataset to do a statistical method called \"boostrapping\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics))"
