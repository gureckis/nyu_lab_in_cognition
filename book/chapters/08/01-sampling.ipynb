    "This chapter by [Todd M. Gureckis](https://gureckislab.org/~gureckis) and is released under the [license for this book](../../LICENSE). Elements of this chapter are adapted from Matthew Crump's excellent [Answering questions with data](https://crumplab.github.io/statistics/) book {cite}`Crump2019` which also draws from from Danielle Navarro's excellent [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com) book {cite}`Navarro2011`.  One major change is the code was adapted to use python and jupyter.  Additional sections were added about counter balancing and stimulus sampling and WEIRD issues in psychological science.\n",

    "\n",
    "The role of descriptive statistics is to concisely summarize what we **do**\n",
    "know. In contrast, the purpose of inferential statistics is to \"learn what we\n",
    "do not know from what we do\". What kinds of things would we like to learn\n",
    "about? And how do we learn them? These are the questions that lie at the heart\n",
    "of inferential statistics, and they are traditionally divided into two \"big\n",
    "ideas\": estimation and hypothesis testing. The goal in this chapter is to\n",
    "introduce sampling theory first because estimation theory doesn't make sense\n",
    "until you understand sampling. So, this chapter dives into the issues of using\n",
    "a sample to learn something more general about the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sampling theory** plays a huge role in specifying the assumptions upon which\n",
    "your statistical inferences rely. And in order to talk about \"making\n",
    "inferences\" the way statisticians think about it, we need to be a bit more\n",
    "explicit about what it is that we're drawing inferences **from** (the sample)\n",
    "and what it is that we're drawing inferences **about** (the population).\n",
    "\n",
    "In almost every situation of interest, what we have available to us as\n",
    "researchers is a **sample** of data. We might have run experiment with some\n",
    "number of participants; a polling company might have phoned some number of\n",
    "people to ask questions about voting intentions; etc. Regardless: the data set\n",
    "available to us is finite, and incomplete. We can't possibly get every person\n",
    "in the world to do our experiment; a polling company doesn't have the time or\n",
    "the money to ring up every voter in the country etc. In our earlier discussion\n",
    "of descriptive statistics, this sample was the only thing we were interested\n",
    "in. Our only goal was to find ways of describing, summarizing and graphing\n",
    "that sample. This is about to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a population\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample is a concrete thing. You can open up a data file, and there's the\n",
    "data from your sample. A **population**, on the other hand, is a more abstract\n",
    "idea. It refers to the set of all possible people, or all possible\n",
    "observations, that you want to draw conclusions about, and is generally\n",
    "**much** bigger than the sample. In an ideal world, the researcher would begin\n",
    "the study with a clear idea of what the population of interest is, since the\n",
    "process of designing a study and testing hypotheses about the data that it\n",
    "produces does depend on the population about which you want to make\n",
    "statements. However, that doesn't always happen in practice: usually the\n",
    "researcher has a fairly vague idea of what the population is and designs the\n",
    "study as best he/she can on that basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it's easy to state the population of interest. For instance, in the\n",
    "\"polling company\" example, the population consisted of all voters enrolled at\n",
    "the a time of the study â€“ millions of people. The sample was a set of 1000\n",
    "people who all belong to that population. In most situations the situation is\n",
    "much less simple. Suppose I run an experiment using 100 undergraduate students\n",
    "as my participants. My goal, as a cognitive scientist, is to try to learn\n",
    "something about how the mind works. So, which of the following would count as\n",
    "\"the population\":\n",
    "\n",
    "- All of the undergraduate psychology students at New York University?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Undergraduate psychology students in general, anywhere in the world?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Americans currently living?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Americans of similar ages to my sample?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anyone currently alive?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any human being, past, present or future?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any biological organism with a sufficient degree of intelligence operating\n",
    "  in a terrestrial environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any intelligent being?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these defines a real group of mind-possessing entities, all of which\n",
    "might be of interest to me as a cognitive scientist, and it's not at all clear\n",
    "which one ought to be the true population of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple random samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Irrespective of how we define the population, the critical point is that the\n",
    "sample is a subset of the population, and our goal is to use our knowledge of\n",
    "the sample to draw inferences about the properties of the population. The\n",
    "relationship between the two depends on the **procedure** by which the sample\n",
    "was selected. This procedure is referred to as a **sampling method**, and it\n",
    "is important to understand why it matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, imagine we have a bag containing 10 chips. Each chip\n",
    "has a unique letter printed on it, so we can distinguish between the 10 chips.\n",
    "The chips come in two colors, black and white.\n"

    "results, but the procedure is identical in each case. The fact that the same\n",
    "procedure can lead to different results each time, we refer to it as a\n",
    "**random** process. However, because we shook the bag before pulling any chips\n",

    "Now consider the evidentiary value of seeing 4 black chips and 0 white chips.\n",

    "sampling scheme is biased to select only black chips, then a sample that\n",
    "consists of only black chips doesn't tell you very much about the population!\n",
    "For this reason, statisticians really like it when a data set can be\n",
    "considered a simple random sample, because it makes the data analysis **much**\n",
    "easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third procedure is worth mentioning. This time around we close our eyes,\n",
    "shake the bag, and pull out a chip. This time, however, we record the\n",
    "observation and then put the chip back in the bag. Again we close our eyes,\n",
    "shake the bag, and pull out a chip. We then repeat this procedure until we\n",
    "have 4 chips. Data sets generated in this way are still simple random samples,\n",
    "but because we put the chips back in the bag immediately after drawing them it\n",

    "discussion of other types of sampling schemes is beyond the scope of this\n",
    "book, but to give you a sense of what's out there I'll list a few of the more\n",
    "important ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stratified sampling**. Suppose your population is (or can be) divided into\n",
    "  several different sub-populations, or **strata**. Perhaps you're running a\n",
    "  study at several different sites, for example. Instead of trying to sample\n",
    "  randomly from the population as a whole, you instead try to collect a\n",
    "  separate random sample from each of the strata. Stratified sampling is\n",
    "  sometimes easier to do than simple random sampling, especially when the\n",
    "  population is already divided into the distinct strata. It can also be more\n",
    "  efficient that simple random sampling, especially when some of the\n",
    "  sub-populations are rare. For instance, when studying schizophrenia it would\n",
    "  be much better to divide the population into two strata (schizophrenic and\n",
    "  not-schizophrenic), and then sample an equal number of people from each\n",
    "  group. If you selected people randomly, you would get so few schizophrenic\n",
    "  people in the sample that your study would be useless. This specific kind of\n",
    "  of stratified sampling is referred to as **oversampling** because it makes a\n",
    "  deliberate attempt to over-represent rare groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Snowball sampling** is a technique that is especially useful when sampling\n",
    "  from a \"hidden\" or hard to access population, and is especially common in\n",
    "  social sciences. For instance, suppose the researchers want to conduct an\n",
    "  opinion poll among transgender people. The research team might only have\n",
    "  contact details for a few trans folks, so the survey starts by asking them\n",
    "  to participate (stage 1). At the end of the survey, the participants are\n",
    "  asked to provide contact details for other people who might want to\n",
    "  participate. In stage 2, those new contacts are surveyed. The process\n",
    "  continues until the researchers have sufficient data. The big advantage to\n",
    "  snowball sampling is that it gets you data in situations that might\n",
    "  otherwise be impossible to get any. On the statistical side, the main\n",
    "  disadvantage is that the sample is highly non-random, and non-random in ways\n",
    "  that are difficult to address. On the real life side, the disadvantage is\n",
    "  that the procedure can be unethical if not handled well, because hidden\n",
    "  populations are often hidden for a reason. I chose transgender people as an\n",
    "  example here to highlight this: if you weren't careful you might end up\n",
    "  outing people who don't want to be outed (very, very bad form), and even if\n",
    "  you don't make that mistake it can still be intrusive to use people's social\n",
    "  networks to study them. It's certainly very hard to get people's informed\n",
    "  consent **before** contacting them, yet in many cases the simple act of\n",
    "  contacting them and saying \"hey we want to study you\" can be hurtful. Social\n",
    "  networks are complex things, and just because you can use them to get data\n",
    "  doesn't always mean you should.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Convenience sampling** is more or less what it sounds like. The samples\n",
    "  are chosen in a way that is convenient to the researcher, and not selected\n",
    "  at random from the population of interest. Snowball sampling is one type of\n",
    "  convenience sampling, but there are many others. A common example in\n",
    "  psychology are studies that rely on undergraduate psychology students. These\n",
    "  samples are generally non-random in two respects: firstly, reliance on\n",
    "  undergraduate psychology students automatically means that your data are\n",
    "  restricted to a single sub-population. Secondly, the students usually get to\n",
    "  pick which studies they participate in, so the sample is a self selected\n",
    "  subset of psychology students not a randomly selected subset. In real life,\n",
    "  most studies are convenience samples of one form or another. This is\n",
    "  sometimes a severe limitation, but not always.\n",

    "#### Example: Issues in Political Polling, Sampling and Bias\n",

    "this fun video by [We the Voters](https://wethevoters.com) \"the science of\n",
    "political polling.\" After you watch, test your understanding with the\n",
    "questions below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} What is the problem with sampling \"likely\" voters?\n",
    ":class: hint\n",
    "- Defining the sample based on a future behavior which might not be accurate\n",
    "- There is no good way to tell if someone is a likely voter\n",

    "The first answer seems more correct.  Likely voting behavior is assessed with several questions about political engagement, and often can be checked later to see it is right.  However it isn't perfect.  Sometimes a particular candidate is really inspiring to people who otherwise don't usually vote and they might be missed by trying to sample \"likely voters.\"\n",

Some pollsters talk of their sampling methods as the \"special sauce\" that they use to get more accurate and they don't release information to the public.  In those cases several decisions might be made about how a sample is constructed that might slant to favor of a viewpoint.  In addition, the way a question is phrased in a survey can influence the answer.\n",

    "### How much does it matter if you don't have a simple random sample?\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so real world data collection tends not to involve nice simple random\n",
    "samples. Does that matter? A little thought should make it clear to you that\n",
    "it **can** matter if your data are not a simple random sample: just think\n",
    "about the difference between Figures {numref}`fig:srs1` and {numref}`fig:brs`.\n",
    "However, it's not quite as bad as it sounds. Some types of biased samples are\n",
    "entirely unproblematic. For instance, when using a stratified sampling\n",
    "technique you actually **know** what the bias is because you created it\n",
    "deliberately, often to **increase** the effectiveness of your study, and there\n",
    "are statistical techniques that you can use to adjust for the biases you've\n",
    "introduced (not covered in this book!). So in those situations it's not a\n",
    "problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally though, it's important to remember that random sampling is a\n",
    "means to an end, not the end in itself. Let's assume you've relied on a\n",
    "convenience sample, and as such you can assume it's biased. A bias in your\n",
    "sampling method is only a problem if it causes you to draw the wrong\n",
    "conclusions. When viewed from that perspective, I'd argue that we don't need\n",
    "the sample to be randomly generated in **every** respect: we only need it to\n",
    "be random with respect to the psychologically-relevant phenomenon of interest.\n",
    "Suppose I'm doing a study looking at working memory capacity. In study 1, I\n",
    "actually have the ability to sample randomly from all human beings currently\n",
    "alive, with one exception: I can only sample people born on a Monday. In study\n",
    "2, I am able to sample randomly from the New York City population. I want to\n",
    "generalize my results to the population of all living humans. Which study is\n",
    "better? The answer, obviously, is study 1. Why? Because we have no reason to\n",
    "think that being \"born on a Monday\" has any interesting relationship to\n",
    "working memory capacity. In contrast, I can think of several reasons why\n",
    "\"being a New Yorker\" might matter. New York City is a wealthy, industrialized\n",
    "city with a very well-developed education system. People growing up in that\n",
    "system will have had life experiences much more similar to the experiences of\n",
    "the people who designed the tests for working memory capacity. This shared\n",
    "experience might easily translate into similar beliefs about how to \"take a\n",
    "test\", a shared assumption about how psychological experimentation works, and\n",
    "so on. These things might actually matter. For instance, \"test taking\" style\n",
    "might have taught the New York City participants how to direct their attention\n",
    "exclusively on fairly abstract test materials relative to people that haven't\n",
    "grown up in a similar environment; leading to a misleading picture of what\n",
    "working memory capacity is.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two points hidden in this discussion. Firstly, when designing your\n",
    "own studies, it's important to think about what population you care about, and\n",
    "try hard to sample in a way that is appropriate to that population. In\n",
    "practice, you're usually forced to put up with a \"sample of convenience\"\n",
    "(e.g., psychology lecturers sample psychology students because that's the\n",
    "least expensive way to collect data, and our coffers aren't exactly\n",
    "overflowing with gold), but if so you should at least spend some time thinking\n",
    "about what the dangers of this practice might be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, if you're going to criticize someone else's study because they've\n",
    "used a sample of convenience rather than laboriously sampling randomly from\n",
    "the entire human population, at least have the courtesy to offer a specific\n",
    "theory as to **how** this might have distorted the results. Remember, everyone\n",
    "in science is aware of this issue, and does what they can to alleviate it.\n",
    "Merely pointing out that \"the study only included people from group BLAH\" is\n",
    "entirely unhelpful, and borders on being insulting to the researchers, who are\n",
    "aware of the issue. They just don't happen to be in possession of the infinite\n",
    "supply of time and money required to construct the perfect sample. In short,\n",
    "if you want to offer a responsible critique of the sampling process, then be\n",
    "**helpful**. Rehashing the blindingly obvious truisms that I've been rambling\n",
    "on about in this section isn't helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WEIRD Samples in Psychological Research\n",
    "\n",
    "One important consequence of psychologists working in universities depending\n",
    "on \"convenience samples\" is that almost all published research on human\n",
    "thinking, reasoning, visual perception, memory, IQ, etc... have been conducted\n",
    "on people from what {cite}`Henrich:2010` call Western, educated,\n",
    "industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies. Under some accounts\n",
    "American undergraduate students are among the \"WEIRD\"est people in the world\n",
    "(no offense). There are several reasons to think that conclusions drawn from\n",
    "research utilizing WEIRD samples does not generalize to the rest of the world.\n",
    "For example, other cultures have different emphases on moral reasoning, the\n",
    "use of analytical reasoning, and even subtle differences in perception\n",
    "({cite}`Henrich:2010`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The concern about this has lead to attempt to create more diverse samples in\n",
    "psychological research including cross cultural studies of cognition and\n",
    "perception, as well as research using the Internet to collect more diverse\n",
    "samples than simple American undergraduates (although admittedly Internet\n",
    "based research may mimic some aspect of the WIERDness of college students).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a huge problem and blends with several other types of biases. However,\n",
    "this is also positive because the recognition of these issues has resulted in\n",
    "entire new fields of psychological research focused on cross-cultural\n",
    "psychology. In the end it is interesting to note that given the cost of\n",
    "collecting samples, the field has **not** moved to randomly sampling across\n",
    "countries and cultures. Instead, what has happened is that people are\n",
    "effectively stratifying their samples by repeating experiments multiple times\n",
    "in different parts of the world and checking if the results line up. Some do\n",
    "and some don't and together they give us a better picture about the nature of\n",
    "human cognition and perception - specifically which things are seemingly\n",
    "cognitive universals (shared by almost all humans) and which are strongly\n",
    "influenced by culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling stimuli\n",
    "\n",
    "In the discussion so far we have talked about samples applying to people. We\n",
    "sample from the population of \"humans\" by recruiting small subsets of humans\n",
    "to take part in our study. However in many experiment designs we also have to\n",
    "sample stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine a study on lexical decision making. In such experiments,\n",
    "participants are shown letter string that either form words (e.g., \"DOG\") or\n",
    "non words (e.g., \"XUNFM\") and we measure the time to make the word or non-word\n",
    "judgment. Often times people are faster with word judgments for familiar or\n",
    "frequent words, etc... However, we can't possibly show each subject every\n",
    "known English word and ever possible non-word string. Instead we have to\n",
    "sample a subset of words and show them to participants. This causes a second\n",
    "generalization problem because often we want to know about how a population of\n",
    "humans reacts to a population of stimuli. We sample both the people we test\n",
    "but also the stimuli we can practically to show in an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we deal with the sampling of stimuli?\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal case we apply the same logic as above - we can use simple random\n",
    "sampling to determine stimuli. For example, if we had a very large dictionary\n",
    "of English words we could use the computer to pseudo-randomly select a word to\n",
    "show on each trial. However, in many experiments listing all possible stimuli\n",
    "is not possible. For example, we can't randomly sample from all possible\n",
    "photographs of a dog. In these cases we, the experimenter, usually select a\n",
    "set of stimuli to use in the experiment. This is a bit akin to the\n",
    "\"convienience sampling\" idea. Perhaps we have a database on images and so we\n",
    "will sample from that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively we can take something akin to a \"stratified\" sampling approach\n",
    "where we specifically choose stimuli that vary in certain ways. For instance\n",
    "in a lexical decision task we might choose several words that are low, medium,\n",
    "and high frequency in the language. We might then show each subject an even\n",
    "number of those stimuli and record their reaction time. At the end of the\n",
    "study we might be interested in median reaction time as a function of these\n",
    "categories. However, we would need to remember that even if reaction time is\n",
    "faster for high frequency words, we can't necessarily generalize to the\n",
    "statement that \"people respond faster to high frequency words\" because our\n",
    "experiment would have only included a **subset** of all possible high\n",
    "frequency words, not randomly sampled words, and even discretized the variable\n",
    "\"frequency\" into three bin (low, medium, high).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several interesting issues involved in the statistical analysis of\n",
    "experiments where stimuli are also randomly sampled from a distribution\n",
    "{cite}`Westfall:2017,Clark:1973`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Sampling of \"extraneous experiment details\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Another place the issue of sampling comes up is with respect to all other\n",
    "aspects of an experiment that you have to specify but aren't really committed\n",
    "to. For instance, what color is the font? Is the 'yes' button on the left or\n",
    "right of the 'no' button? Is the text in 12pt font or 16 pt font. All of these\n",
    "variables **could** have an effect, although intuition says they are unlikely\n",
    "to be systematically biasing the results for most experiments. The problem\n",
    "with social sciences and psychology in general is that the number of the\n",
    "\"other\" variables is huge. One approach is just to set them to reasonable\n",
    "values (e.g., make a font clear and readable by most people) and ensure that\n",
    "the setting doesn't change across different treatments in your experiment.\n",
    "Another approach is -- you guessed it -- simple random assignment. You can\n",
    "essentially randomly sample a color or randomly sample a font size for each\n",
    "subject so that this variable will \"wash out\" across many participants.\n",
    "Generally speaking most people just set these variables to a fixed value\n",
    "because the choices here rarely have a substantial effect (this is not to say\n",
    "they have no effect... if you make the font so small noone can read the\n",
    "instructions, then you probably will observe a change in behavior). However,\n",
    "rarely is the question \"how does font size affect cognition?\" but instead\n",
    "questions like \"what is the effect of working memory load on performance in a\n",
    "learning task?\" in which case one doesn't expect font size to be the most\n",
    "important possible confound.\n"

    "So far we have talked about sampling from a population -- the reasons we do\n",
    "it, how to do it, etc... Given a sample we use compute various descriptive\n",
    "statistics (covered in the previous chapter) that characterize the central\n",
    "tendency or variability of the sample. However, while descriptive statistics\n",
    "are nice they are usually not what we want to know when we conduct a research\n",
    "study. Instead we are interested in **estimation** of aspects (we'll call them\n",
    "parameters) of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we go to Brooklyn and 100 of the locals are kind enough to sit through\n",
    "an IQ test. The average IQ score among these people turns out to be\n",
    "$\\bar{X}=98.5$. Although it is nice to know that _this specific_ group of\n",
    "people has this average IQ that isn't very general. Can we say anything more\n",
    "broad? Like given this information what is the true mean IQ for the entire\n",
    "population of Brooklyn? Obviously, we don't know the answer to that question.\n",
    "It could be $97.2$, but if could also be $103.5$. Our sampling isn't\n",
    "exhaustive so we cannot give a definitive answer. Nevertheless if forced to\n",
    "give a \"best guess\" we'd probably have to say $98.5$. That's the essence of\n",
    "statistical estimation: giving a best guess. We're using the _sample_ mean as\n",
    "the best guess of the _population_ mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the moment let's make sure you recognize that the sample statistic and the\n",
    "estimate of the population parameter are conceptually different things. A\n",
    "sample statistic is a description of your data, whereas the estimate is a\n",
    "guess about the population. With that in mind, statisticians often use\n",
    "different notation to refer to them. For instance, if true population mean is\n",
    "denoted $\\mu$, then we would use $\\hat\\mu$ to refer to our estimate of the\n",
    "population mean. In contrast, the sample mean is denoted $\\bar{X}$ or\n",
    "sometimes $m$. However, in simple random samples, the estimate of the\n",
    "population mean is identical to the sample mean: if I observe a sample mean of\n",
    "$\\bar{X} = 98.5$, then my estimate of the population mean is also\n",
    "$\\hat\\mu = 98.5$. To help keep the notation clear, here's a handy table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Symbol      | What is it?                     | Do we know what it is?            |\n",
    "| ----------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |\n",
    "| $\\bar{X}$   | Sample mean                     | Yes, calculated from the raw data |\n",
    "| $\\mu$       | True population mean            | Almost never known for sure       |\n",
    "| $\\hat{\\mu}$ | Estimate of the population mean | Yes, identical to the sample mean |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimating the standard deviation of the population\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the mean, our estimate of the population parameter (i.e.\n",
    "$\\hat\\mu$) turned out to identical to the corresponding sample statistic (i.e.\n",
    "$\\bar{X}$). However, that's not always true. To see this, let's have a think\n",
    "about how to construct an **estimate of the population standard deviation**,\n",
    "which we'll denote $\\hat\\sigma$. What shall we use as our estimate in this\n",
    "case? Your first thought might be that we could do the same thing we did when\n",
    "estimating the mean, and just use the sample statistic as our estimate. That's\n",
    "almost the right thing to do, but not quite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why. Suppose I have a sample that contains a single observation. For\n",
    "this example, it helps to consider a sample where you have no intuitions at\n",
    "all about what the true population values might be, so let's use something\n",
    "completely fictitious. Suppose the observation in question measures the\n",
    "**cromulence** of my shoes. It turns out that my shoes have a cromulence\n",
    "of 20. So here's my sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "`20`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a perfectly legitimate sample, even if it does have a sample size of\n",
    "$N=1$. It has a sample mean of 20, and because every observation in this\n",
    "sample is equal to the sample mean (obviously!) it has a sample standard\n",
    "deviation of 0. As a description of the **sample** this seems quite right: the\n",
    "sample contains a single observation and therefore there is no variation\n",
    "observed within the sample. A sample standard deviation of $s = 0$ is the\n",
    "right answer here. But as an estimate of the **population** standard\n",
    "deviation, it feels completely insane, right? Admittedly, you and I don't know\n",
    "anything at all about what \"cromulence\" is, but we know something about data:\n",
    "the only reason that we don't see any variability in the **sample** is that\n",
    "the sample is too small to display any variation! So, if you have a sample\n",
    "size of $N=1$, it **feels** like the right answer is just to say \"no idea at\n",
    "all\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that you **don't** have the same intuition when it comes to the sample\n",
    "mean and the population mean. If forced to make a best guess about the\n",
    "population mean, it doesn't feel completely insane to guess that the\n",
    "population mean is 20. Sure, you probably wouldn't feel very confident in that\n",
    "guess, because you have only the one observation to work with, but it's still\n",
    "the best guess you can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's extend this example a little. Suppose I now make a second observation.\n",
    "My data set now has $N=2$ observations of the cromulence of shoes, and the\n",
    "complete sample now looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`20, 22`\n",
    "\n",
