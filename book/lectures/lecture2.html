# What went wrong and why?

- A failure to detect .blue[confounding] variables.  

.infobox[
    **Confounding variable**  
In statistics, a confounding variable (also confounding factor, hidden variable, lurking variable, a confound, or confounder) is an extraneous variable in a statistical model that correlates (positively or negatively) with both the dependent variable and the independent variable. - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding">WP</a>
]

- Was it sloppy science? Hard to say.  The relevant variables themselves were poorly understood.
- **Big challenge** in cognitive science.  What information in the environment do people use and how?  Difficult to control, must proceed with extreme caution.

# The number concept game
.small[I have a concept in mind involving triplets of numbers.
Your job is to guess the concept by asking questions.
To start will I will tell you that the triplet 2,4,6 belongs to the concept.
Now, try entering other triplets.  Items marked green are in the concept, while
items marked red are not.  Try entering other triplets to determine what you
think the rule I am considering is.]
<hr>
.large[
.green[**(2, 4, 6)**]
<br>
]
<br />
<br />
Try it (to enter the above triplet just type '2,4,6' without quotes or spaces):
.large[
<input type="text" maxlength="9" size="10" id="wason1entry"/>  
<input type="submit" value="submit" onclick="javascript:wason1add();"/><input type="submit" value="i'm done/give up"onclick="javascript:wason1done();" />
]

---
class: light

# Typical result

- People usually first think the concept is "even, increasing numbers"
- They then try to test items like (8, 10, 12)... is that one you tried or thought of?
- However, imagine that the first hypothesis (even increasing numbers) is correct.  Then these types of test items are unlikely to generate anything other than a long sequence of "true" responses thus little is learned.
- No amount of positive testing can ever completely support a hypothesis or rule
- Instead people should try _disconfirmatory_ examples such as (3, 2, 1) which are predicted to be 'false' under the hypothesis.

# Correct Answer



- Looking at E is good...  if there isn't an even number on the other side it falsifies the rule, otherwise not.
- K we have no prediction given the rule, so either outcome (even/odd) has no bearing on the rule
- 4 is bad because if you look at 4 it could be a vowel but if it isn't a vowel there's nothing wrong with that.
- 7 is good because if even it will mean the rule is false.  If not even then nothing new learned.

# What is going on?

Tendency of humans (scientists included) to seek positive examples of a theory rather than the
things that would refute it.
<br><br>
.infobox[
    **Confirmation Bias**  
Confirmation bias (also called confirmatory bias or myside bias) is a tendency of people to favor information that confirms their beliefs or hypotheses.  Experiments have repeatedly found that people tend to test hypotheses in a one-sided way, by searching for evidence consistent with the hypothesis they hold at a given time. Rather than searching through all the relevant evidence, they ask questions that are phrased so that an affirmative answer supports their hypothesis. They look for the consequences that they would expect if their hypothesis were true, rather than what would happen if it were false. - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">WP</a>

# Falsification

Karl Popper (1935) - "The Logic of Scientific Discovery"

]
---
class: light

.quote[
Popper argued strongly against the latter, holding that scientific theories are abstract in nature, and can be tested only indirectly, by reference to their implications. He also held that scientific theory, and human knowledge generally, is irreducibly conjectural or hypothetical, and is generated by the creative imagination in order to solve problems that have arisen in specific historico-cultural settings. Logically, no number of positive outcomes at the level of experimental testing can confirm a scientific theory, but a single counterexample is logically decisive: it shows the theory, from which the implication is derived, to be false. Popper's account of the logical asymmetry between verification and falsifiability lies at the heart of his philosophy of science. It also inspired him to take falsifiability as his criterion of demarcation between what is and is not genuinely scientific: a theory should be considered scientific if and only if it is falsifiable.  - [WP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper)

    **Correlational study**  
Tracks the statistical relationship between two variables with limited ability to assess
**causation**.  However, important tool... can suggest important hypotheses for experimental
studies.  Correlations are informative also...  just open to many interpretations!  
]
<br><br>
#Examples

- **Individual Differences in W.M.**  We think that subjects who have higher working memory ability will perform better on a learning task.  We measure each subject’s W.M. capacity prior to the experiment then give them the test.  We find that the higher the score on the W.M.. test, the better they are at the second test.

- **Brain imaging** - BOLD signal recorded in visual cortex in response to a visual memory task.  Does this mean visual cortex is the locus of memory?  No!  Correlated signal... the memories could be elsewhere in the brain

# Experimental study

Examples:

- **Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)** We believe some region of frontal cortex is critical for certain types of behavior.  Using TMS selectively “deactivate” this region and measure behavior in the task compared to a control.  The independent variable is manipulation of the TMS (on/off).  The dependent measure is whatever the task involves.

- **Category Learning**  We think certain types of categories are easier to learn than others.  Give each set of subjects a different structure and measure error rate.  The independent variables is the problem type.  The dependent measure is accuracy or learning rate.

Likely .blue[correlational] because it would be unethical to perform a randomized control.  All one could
even possibly conclude is that heavy drinking is _associated_ with poor grades.

Likely .blue[experimental] assuming words were randomized with within-subject or
between-subject.

##  A private school advertises that a group of their students recently scored 10 points higher on a math test than a group of other students from a public school? What can you conclude from this advertisment? Is this an example of an experiment?

--

Not an experiment since assignment to group not controlled even though there is direct comparison between two samples.
Many possible confounding variables.
