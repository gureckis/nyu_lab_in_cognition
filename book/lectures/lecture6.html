# Chance does things

---

class: light

# Big ideas for this course

1. Psychology interpets patterns in data to draw conclusions about psychological processes

--

2. Chance can produce "patterns" in data

--

3. **Problem**: How can we know if the pattern is real, or simply a random accident produced by chance

---

class: light


# Solutions

1. Need to understand what chance is

--

2. Need to find out what chance can actually do in a particular situation

--

3. Create tools to help us determine whether chance was likely or unlikely to produce patterns in the data

# Probability Basics

---

class: light


# What is a probability?

- A number bounded between 0 and 1

- Describes the "chances" or "likelihood" of an event

---

class: light

# Proportions and Percentages

- Percentage (%) : A ratio between event frequency, and total frequency, expressed in units of 100.
- Proportion : a decimal version (range between 0-1)

`\(100\% = \frac{100}{100} = 1 = 1*100 = 100\%\)`

`\(50\% = \frac{50}{100} = .5 = .5*100 = 50\%\)`

`\(\frac{2}{4} = .5 = .5*100 = 50\%\)`

---

class: light

# Two probability statements

- A coin has a 50% chance of landing heads

  - p(heads) = .5

--

- There is a 10% chance of rain tomorrow
  - p(rain tomorrow) = .1

---

class: light

# Frequentist vs. Bayesian

Probability is defined differently depending on philosophical tradition.

1. Frequentist: The long-run chances (odds) of an event occurring

2. Bayesian: Degree of belief

---

class: light

# A fair coin

A fair coin has a 50% chance of landing heads or tails

- Frequentist: If you flip this coin an infinity of times, **in the long run** half of the outcome will be heads, and half will be tails

- Bayesian: I am uncertain about the outcome, I can't predict what it will be.

---

class: light

# 10% chance of rain tomorrow

10% chance of rain tomorrow refers to a single event that hasn't yet occurred

- Frequentist: I don't know what to say. Tomorrow it will rain or not rain, so there will be a 0% or 100% chance of rain, we'll find out after tomorrow happens

- Bayesian: It is unlikely to rain tomorrow, I won't bring an umbrella.

# Summary of simulation

1. Chance produces a range of outcomes (number of heads out of 10)

2. Chance most frequently produces 5 heads and 5 tails

---

class: light

# Samples and distributions

How do samples relate to distributions?

--

  - Samples come from distributions
--

  - Samples approximate the distribution they came from as sample-size increases

---

class: light

# Is my sample likely?

Let's say you take a sample of numbers from a distribution.

1. Is your sample representative of the population?
2. Was your sample likely (you would usually get a sample like this), or unlikely (you got a weird sample, usually you would not get a sample like this)

---

class: light

# Simulation and sampling

How can we know if a sample we obtained is "normal", or "weird"?

--

- We can find out by simulating the process of sampling.
- We sample some numbers, measure the sample, then repeat
- We can now look at how our measurement of the sample behaves

---

# Samples and populations

---

class: light

# Samples and populations

- Population: A defined set of things

- Sample: a subset of the population

---

class: light

# Random Sampling

- A process for generating a sample (taking things from a population)

--
- Random samples ensure that each value in a sample is drawn **independently** from other values

--
- all values in the population have a chance of being in the sample

---

class: light

# Example: Sampling heights of people

Let's say we wanted to know something about how tall people are. We can't measure the entire population (it's too big). So we take a sample.

--

What would happen if:

1. We only measured really tall people (biased sample)

--

2. We randomly measured a bunch of people?


---

class: light

# Population statistics

Populations have statistics. For example,

The population of all people has:

1. A distributions of heights
2. The distribution has a mean (mean height of all people)
3. The distribution has a standard deviation

---

class: light

# The population problem

In the real world, we usually do not have all of the data for the entire population.

So, we never actually know:

1. The population distribution
2. The population mean
3. The population standard deviation, etc.


---

class: light

# The sampling solution

Unknown: The population

Solution: Take a sample of the population

1. Samples will tend to look the population they came from, especially when sample-size (N) is large.

2. We can use the sample to **estimate** the population.

---

class: light

# The sampling problem

We take samples, and use them to estimate things. This works well when we have large, representative samples. 

But, how do we know if the sample we obtained is "normal", or happens to be "weird"?

Solution: We need to learn how the process of sampling works. We can use R to simulate the process of sampling. Then we can see how samples behave.

---

class: light

# Samples become populations

- As sample-size increases, the sample becomes more like the population. 

- As sample N approaches the population N, the sample becomes the population.

---

class: light

# Law of large numbers

- As sample-size increases, properties of the sample become more like properties of the population

Example:

- As sample-size increases, the mean of the sample becomes more like the mean of the population

# Sampling distributions

---

class: light

# What are sampling distributions?

- Definition: The distribution of a sample statistic

- Example: 
  - Many samples are drawn from the same distribution
  - A statistic (e.g., mean, standard deviation) is computed for each sample, and saved
  - The sampling distribution is the distribution of the measured statistic for each sample
  - Sampling distributions can be simulated in R

# Sampling distribution is bell-shaped

Notice that the sampling distribution of the mean is bell-shaped, also called a **Normal Distribution**.

&lt;img src="figs-crump/distribution/4unifmany-1.png" width="50%" /&gt;

---

class: light

# Sampling distributions for anything

A sampling distribution can be found for any sample statistic.

1. Choose a statistic to measure (e.g., mean, median, variance, standard deviations, max, min, etc.)
2. Measure statistics for each sample
3. Plot the sampling distribution

class: light

# Use for sampling distributions?

Question: What does a sampling distribution tell us?

Answer: 

- The distribution of values a sample statistic can take, for a sample of a particular size

In other words,

- Gives us information about range and probability of obtaining particular sample statistics

---

class: light

# Sampling distribution of the mean

&lt;img src="figs-crump/distribution/4unifmany-1.png" width="592" /&gt;

---

class: light

# Standard error of the mean (SEM)

- Definition: the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample means

Formulas: Can be computed directly for samples of any size if you know the standard deviation of the population distribution.

`\(\text{SEM}=\frac{\text{standard deviation}}{\sqrt{N}}\)`

`\(\text{SEM}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}\)`

`\(\sigma\)` = population standard deviation

---

class: light

# SEM

What does the SEM (standard error of the mean) tell you.

- Let's say your sample mean was 5, and the SEM was 2.

- The SEM is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean

- Now you know that your sample mean is 5, but as an estimate of the population mean, that number varies a little bit. SEM tells you how much in standard deviation units.


---

class: light

# Central limit theorem

With enough samples, sampling distributions are approximately **normal distributions**

- Sampling distributions have the same shape as a normal distribution, even when the distribution that the sample came from does not have a normal shape.
