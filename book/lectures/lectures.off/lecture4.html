# Agenda

1. Sampling
1. Design of experiments practicum
1. A gentle introduction to data analysis and statistics in Excel

---

class: light, 

# Sampling

- What to estimate some measure(s) for a large or infinite population, so test a subset of that population
- **Sample frame**: list to sample from
- Major concerns in sampling:
    - **Power** - do you have a large enough sample to detect an effect?
    - **Bias** - does your method of sampling asymptotically converge to the correct estimate?
    - **Independence** - do you modify sampling scheme after beginning data collection?

---

class: light, 

# Power

- **Power** is the probability of detecting an effect of a known size given some sample
- **Power analysis** (later in the class) is how to find this out:
    - A priori: how big a sample do we need
    - Post-hoc: how much power did the study have?
- Intuitive power analysis (for when you don't know how big the effect is)
    - How many height measurements would we need to get a reliable difference between men and women?
    - How about a reliable measure of colorblindness among genders (~2%)

class: light, 

# Bias: Non-probability sampling

- Not all members of the population have a chance of being included
- **Convenience sample**
    - Cheap, easy, but can have issues in generalizabiliy
- **Volunteer sample**
    - Selection bias likely: who are the people who would want to be in this study?
- Key concept here is to ask about ways in which sample bias could affect results
    - This may not generalize from study to study: concerns vary  
    
---

class: light, 

# Random sampling

- All members of the population have a chance to be included
- **Simple random sampling**
    - Easy to do if you have some method for doing it
- **Systematic sampling**
    - e.g., take every kth person
- **Stratified sampling**
    - break sample into representative sub-groups

---

class: light, 

# Two sampling problems

- Nationally-representative survey
    - Want to make sure that minority groups are appropriately represented
    - but if you sample randomly, may end up undersampling minorities by accident
- School-based intervention
    - If you sample students randomly, you will end up visiting 100 schools
    - You will also underweight small schools

---

class: light, 

# Stratified/hierarchical sampling

- Primary sampling units (psu) are selected with a probability proportional to the size of the target population
    - e.g., minority population, schools
- Secondard sampling units (ssu) is selected at random from each of the psu
    - e.g., individuals, students in schools

---

class: light, 

# Two stratification strategies

- Proportional
    - Sample from psu proportional to fraction of the total population
    - e.g., make sure you have the same proportion of the minority group as the national population
- Disproportionate/optimal
    - Sample from psus relative to their variability or their interest
    - e.g., get more samples from minority groups so you can appropriately estimate their views
 
---

class: light, 

# When would you stratify?

- If you want to be sure of the precision for each subgroup
    - e.g., nationally representative surveys
- Because of some practicality
    - e.g., students are in schools
- When sampling problems are different for different populations
    - e.g., survey of prisoners versus jobless adults versus employed adults
- **Gains in precision of result** when
    - e.g., measure of interest might correlate with strata (e.g., learning outcomes and school size)
    - hence random sample of student without stratification may undersample kids from small schools

# Pre-specification of sampling

- Make a plan and write it down
    - Why?
- Two paths
    - Avoid contingent data collection
        - Pre-specificy data collection plan
        - Analyze as much as you want along the way
    - Correct for contingent data collection
        - Sequential analysis
        - Bayesian methods
        - When would you do this?

# Sampling: the bottom line

.infobox[Think about whether bias introduced by sampling
method could have had something to do with observed effect.  

- No  clear procedure for this
- depends on the claim you are making,
- and the generalization you hope to make from your data!]

# Ground rules of experiment psych

- Interested in psychological behavior, phenomenon, or constructs
    - Sources of the constructs
    - Effects of other factors
    - Individual variability
- Create an **instrument** that **operationalizes** the construct
    - Usually easy to measure quantitatively
    - Takes behavior out of the real world, brings it into the lab where it can be manipulated
- Make argument about how to connect this instrument to the construct of interest



---

class: light, 

# Key Concepts

- **Reliability**: how well did we measure the construct of interest?
    - What is the error in the measurment?
    - What is the replicability of this experiment?
    - Was the result due to chance?
- **Validity**: how well does this effect generalize to the phenomenon of interest?
    - **Internal** validity: interpretation valid?
    - **External** validity: construct valid?

# Is Raven's reliable?

- 576 veterns took Raven's 
- Split half correlation between scores = 0.93

---


class: light, 

# Is Raven's internally valid?

- **Confounds** in administration or in design?
    - Unwanted factors affecting results
    - e.g., item and order effect in other types of experiments
- **Demand characterisitcs**?
    - Unusual for difficult performance-based measures
    - but potentially common for measures of opinion, reaction, etc... 

---


class: light, 

# Is Raven's externally valid?

- Do they measure something outside of themselves?
    - Correlate with other IQ tests
    - Predict life outcome

# Issues affecting internal validity

- How well as study was run
- How confidently you can conclude effects were produced solely by IV
- Was it really the treatment that cause the difference between subjects in the control and experimental groups?


---


class: light, 

# Issues affecting internal validity

- **Stimulus specificity**
    - Is effect general across items?
- **Maturation**
    - order effects: subjects become tired or bored, more or less motivated
- **Testing effects**
    - a pretest can affect subject's performance on a post-test
- **Selection**
    - subjects in comparison (e.g., the control and experimental) groups should be functionally equivalent at the beginning of study
- **Experiment Morality/Attrition**
    - If one group has higher dropout than others, may bias selection

---


class: light, 

# Issues affecting external validity

- **Interaction** between sampling scheme and treatment condition
- The performance of subjects in some studies is more a product or reaction to the experimental setting than to the independent variable
     - Subjects who know they are participants in a study, or who are aware of being observed, etc... may react differently to the treatment than a subject who experienced the treatment but was not aware of being observed (Hawthorne Effect)
